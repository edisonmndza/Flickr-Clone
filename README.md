***Flickr Clone***

This project is a clone of flickr tasked by my employer at the CFIA to demonstrate skills learned from training.
The project was written in Java with Android Studio (IDE), and git/Bitbucket (SVC).

Some of the Java API's I learned are:
- Camera API
- Firebase Storage/Firestore
- RecyclerView and Custom Adapters

Project Members:
- Edison Mendoza (me)
- Maxwell Yang
